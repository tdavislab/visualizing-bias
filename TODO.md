# TODOs

### Bug fixes
- [x] Change debiasing from `inplace` to `copy`
- [x] PCA on A + B only, then apply the projection matrix on the third.

### Different debiasing techniques
- [x] Linear Debiasing
- [ ] OSCaR - Orthogonal Subspace Correction and Rectification

### UI changes
- [x] Dim other points on hover
- [x] Align axis ranges for PCA and Two-means
- [x] Remove PCA picture
- [x] Toggle mean-line and purple points
- [ ] Remove points without removing the visualization of that word
- [ ] 3D PCA, future stuff
- [ ] Make the mean direction always horizontal and mean 1 on right and mean 2 on left


### Animation Tasks
- [x] Animate collapse to two-means
- [ ] Animate PCA as rotation and scaling (but from what to what?)
- [ ] Mean point in debiasing (right)
- [ ] Animate between one debiasing method to another to show difference between methods

### Miscellaneous
- Assumption on gender of name
- Projection on normal to max margin plane
- PCA with maximal alignment
- Check Viz for debiasing for what types of techniques they've used
